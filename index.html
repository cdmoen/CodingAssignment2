<!-- Recipe Choice

1. Choose a recipe for any kind of food or beverage whose name begins with the first letter of your last name.  For example my Last Name is Duncan, which starts with a D, so I will publish a recipe for something that starts with D..

A quick google search turns up plenty of options.

I'm going to use Deviled Eggs.

TEXT CONTENT

3. Navigate to the index.html page, enter content for your recipe, and mark it up with HTML. You may use my example pictured above as a guide. (If you submit my content and / or style you may receive a 0 for the assignment.)

4. As always, when we use someone else's materials, we must cite our sources.

     a. If you created your recipe you can simply include Recipe by: Your Name.

     b. If this recipe was created by someone else, please include Recipe by: and then an attribution to the source.

5. Include an appropriate <title> that describes the recipe page content, which will display in the browser tab.

 

IMAGE DOWNLOAD

1. Navigate to https://images.google.com/to locate an open license image that works for your recipe.

2. To locate an open license image, select Tools, Usage Rights, Creative Commons Licenses, which will filter your options. Read more about this process and usage rights at https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/29508.

3. Make a note of the attribution required (if any) which you will include on the web page you are building.

4. Download and save a local copy of the image-file on your computer.

5. Move it into your images directory 

6. As needed, rename the image-file with a descriptive, best-practice file name.

 

IMAGE CODING

1. Use the <img> tag in display your image.

2. As needed, rename the image-file with a descriptive, best-practice file name.

3. Enter the correct file path in the src attribute of the img tag.  Linking based on the pictures of web root above, it should be something like  images/filename.jpg

4. Include descriptive alternative text for the images using the alt="" attribute.

5. Research and use <figure> tags around your <img> tag.

6. Use <figcaption> tags to include an attribution for the image you used. The <figcaption> tag is used with <figure> tags.

Note that the image displays slightly indented. This is a result of using <figure> tags. The <figure> tags include an indent by default. Even if you do not like the indent, ignore it for now. You can always remove it with CSS later.
Troubleshooting Links

    Is the link coded in properly formed syntax?
    Is the filepath correct?
    Does each file (originating and target) reside in the file system where your code points?
    Never use spaces in your filepath/filename!
    NEVER use a local file path! on Windows those start with a "C:\" or "file:\"

Test your new web page in the browser to make sure everything looks how you want it and your image loads.
VALIDATION

1. Navigate to https://validator.w3.org/ and validate your HTML page.

     a. To validate the page, click on the Validate by File Upload tab.

     b. Browse through all errors and warnings, make needed corrections, and upload again until your HTML validates.

2. Once your page fully validates, take screenshot of your validation confirmation page, save it as valid-html-recipe-xxxxx, where xxxxx is your last name.

3. Upload the screenshot image in your images file directory.
